Hi, you can call me Puth. I'm currently based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. I earned my Bachelor of Engineering at the Australian National University, double majoring in Electronics & Communication Systems and Mechatronic Systems.

Although my engineering background isnâ€™t in software, Iâ€™ve always had a strong interest in it. During university, I found myself drawn to programming even outside of coursework, and that interest has only grown over time. Iâ€™ve been steadily upskilling through personal projects and recent work, and Iâ€™m now exploring software development more intentionally.
