Hi, you can call me Puth. I'm currently based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. I'm a fifth-year Bachelor of Engineering student at the Australian National University, double majoring in Electronics & Communication Systems and Mechatronic Systems. I'm also exploring software engineering to broaden my technical skill set.
